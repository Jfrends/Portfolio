            During my two years as a high school student, I have been able to attend an amazingly well put together field trip, and there have been a couple guest speakers that intrigued me as well. One speaker, Jason Yosinski, talked about machine learning and how it is being used in many fields like robotics and car manufacturing. An especially interesting part was the demo he showed, where the machine could recognize certain objects in an image and return what they are. He also went into some specifics which were quite fascinating. He talked about vectors and matrices, which was very intriguing for someone like me who is thinking about going into that field.

            The only field trip that I've been to so far was a virtual trip to the Livermore Airport, where we met the airport manager, David Decoteau, as well as Sean Moran, the assistant manager. They talked about the specifics of running the airport, where they get their funds, the general infrastructure, and more. We then got to take a virtual flight that took us over the Dublin High School campus. After that, we met Doug Henson, who was a retired military pilot who told us about the Air Force and military and recreational formation flying. Overall it was a very interesting field trip that opened my eyes to the amazing field of aviation.

            Although I haven’t had my mentor yet, I have had some work experience. I volunteer at the SPCA in Dublin. I help with everything when it comes to the cats, from feeding them to cleaning up after them. It has helped me get a feel for a professional work environment, which isn’t something I see every day. I have also done some small work projects for my mom. She might “hire” me to do some data entry work for her company, it isn’t much, but it will give me the experience to be a success further up the road.
