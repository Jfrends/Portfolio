            <p>Hi, my name is Joshua Frendberg and this is my Online Engineering Portfolio! I am 17 years old and a junior at Dublin High School in Dublin California. I have always been fascinated by computers and ways to make them do neat things, so I have been coding for a few years now. I also love sports and play competitive ice hockey for the Tri-Valley Blue Devils. I am an only child and love to do the typical teenager things like playing video games, listening to music, and hanging out with my friends on the weekends. However, I definitely prioritize my academics and strive for a 4.0+ GPA every semester, which is a goal I have achieved so far.
            </p>
            <br>
	          <p>To get into the specifics of my academics related to engineering, I am currently taking PLTW Cybersecurity, and have been accepted into the computer science pathway of the Dublin High Engineering Academy. There are many careers that interest me in engineering, but the two that interest me most are software engineering and network pen testing. I would be more than happy if I was able to pursue either of these careers, so for now I take some free online classes and try my best to pick up as much material as possible.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>While in High School, I have made several achievements that include achieving a 4.3 GPA in both semesters of the 2020-2021 school year despite facing the challenges of distance learning. I have maintained a 4.0 unweighted GPA throughout my time in high school. I am a very determined and optimistic person, so I am certain that I have a bright future ahead of me. Please feel free to look around my site and see what I have been up to recently.
            </p>
