            <p>Hi, my name is Josh Frendberg and this is my Online Portfolio! I am 19 years old and a freshman at Cal Poly SLO. I have always been fascinated by computers and I love problem solving, so naturally I have been coding for a long time. I also love sports and played competitive ice hockey for most of my life. I am an only child and my hobbies include working out, playing the piano, and hiking. However, I definitely prioritize my academics and strive for a 4.0 GPA every quarter.
            </p>
            <br>
	          <p>I am currently taking CSC 349 Design and Analysis of Algorithms. There are many careers that interest me in computer science, but the two that interest me most are software engineering and artificial intelligence engineering. Because of this, I am concentrating in AI and ML. I also plan to graduate with my Bachelor's degree a year early in the spring of 2026 and pursue a masters degree in computer science through the 4+1 program. Hopefully I will be graduating with a masters in just 4 years as opposed to the usual 6.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
            Outside of the classroom, I also love animals. I volunteer at the on campus cat shelter which is always the highlight of my week. Additionally I am a member of Poly Pups, where I help raise guide dogs for the blind.
