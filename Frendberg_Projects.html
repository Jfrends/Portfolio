            <h5><b>AP CSP</b></h5>
            <h6>September 2019</h6>
            <p>In this project, my teammate and I successfully made a dinosaur platformer. Complete with 10 levels and simple obstacles. I did most of the coding and learned how to schedule my work in order to maximize productivity.The hardest part was definitely the physics, but I taught myself how to make blocks using resources on the internet and got it to work pretty well.</p>

          <h6>October 2019</h6>
          <p>In this project, my partner and I made a simple quiz app complete with a scoring system and multiple trivia genres. In this project I did most of the coding and used my previously learned App Inventor skills to make a pretty good app, utilizing the time management skills I learned in the previous project.</p>

            <h6>February 2021</h6>
            <p>In this project, my teammates and I made various upcycled products from recyclable materials such as cardboard and plastic bottles. The product that I produced was a phone stand made from reused cardboard. This was a different type of project in comparison to my previous coding projects, but the same basic principles of engineering design applied.</p>

            <h5><b>POE</b></h5>
            <h6>March 2021</h6>
            <p>In this project, my teammates and I each made a few bridges in a bridge simulation program. The program gave us feedback on what we could improve by telling us the amount of tension or compression each of the members went through, and the goal was to make the cheapest bridge possible. It helped us learn about truss structures and the ways that different types of bridges work. My role in my team was the project manager, so I gained some important leadership and organization skills that would apply to future school and work projects.</p>

            <h3>It's a Trap!</h3>
            <h5><b>PLTW Cybersecurity</b></h5>
            <h6>September 2021</h6>
            <p>In this project I worked with a partner, Edmund Feng, to clear a digital machine of any malware or suspicious activity. We used our newly learned skills in device security to ensure that there were no suspicious files or processes running on the device. I was the team leader and gained leadership and documentation skills that will apply to different projects in the future.</p>

            <p>In this project I worked with my partner, Edmund Feng, to secure a digital machine from any potential cyber threats. We secured the firewall and deleted any suspicious files and processes that we found. We also recovered deleted files from the machine's recycling bin. This project gave me applicable skills in cybersecurity as well as facilitation skills.</p>

            <h3>Spongebob Game</h3>
            <h5><b>AP CSA</b></h5>
            <h6>June 2022</h6>
            <p>In this project I worked individually to create a game in the Greenfoot Java development environment. It was a great experience to help me develop skills in Java programming as well as game development as I had to troubleshoot all the problems on my own since I was the only team member. This project took me from knowing next to nothing about the Java language to being sufficient in just a few weeks.</p>

            <h3>Chatbot</h3>
            <h5><b>AP CSA</b></h5>
            <h6>November 2022</h6>
            <p>In this project I worked with my partner Diego to design a chatbot using the Java programming language. We were able to create an algorithm that could hold a conversation as the soccer player Lionel Messi. Our code scanned the input for various keywords, phrases, and question structures to formulate the best response and also implemented a memory system which allowed it to call back to earlier points in the conversation. This project shaped the way I think about AI and other chatbots and also taught me a lot about natural language processing and the methods that can be used by machines to mimic human interaction.</p>
